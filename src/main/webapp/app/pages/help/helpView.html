          <h3>What are DevBits?</h3>
          <p>DevBits are the currency system used on DevWars. They can be earned through a variety of means, and spent
            in many different ways.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="dbh2">
          <h3>How can I earn DevBits?</h3>
          <p>There are a huge amount of ways to earn DevBits! They are earned through your participation around the site
            and during streams. Here is list of some of the ways you can pick up some Bits!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Being present in the Twitch stream during a live game</li>
            <li>Participating in DevWars</li>
            <li>Being helpful on the website</li>
            <li>Sharing your badges and achievements</li>
            <li>Answering surveys</li>

          <p>There are also plenty of other ways to earn yourself some DevBits, with many more planned to come in the
            future. We could tell you all about it, but where would the fun be if in that?</p>
        </div>
        <div id="dbh3">
          <h3>How can I spend the DevBits I’ve earned?</h3>
          <p>The shop is the marketplace to spend your hard earned Bits. Whether it’s to have a custom avatar on your
            profile or to change your title, the choice is yours! You can see how many DevBits you have earned by
            checking your profile on the <a href="/#/dashboard">Dashboard</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="dbh4">
          <h3>Can I sell my DevBits?</h3>
          <p>No. DevBits have no monetary value, and cannot be traded or sold.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="dbh5">
          <h3>I was in a live Twitch stream, but my DevBits weren’t added to my account!</h3>
          <p>Make sure that you have connected your Twitch account on DevWars. If you haven’t done this, there is no way
            to check whether you have been in stream or not!
            If your Twitch account is already connected to your DevWars account, and you believe that your DevBits
            aren’t correct, please contact a member of the DevWars team via the <a href="/#/contact">Contact</a> page.
          </p>
          <p>Alternatively, you may have attempted to try and spend your DevBits too early! DevBits earned within the
            DevWars Twitch stream are updated to your account every 15 minutes. </p>
