  <div class="left">
    <h3>What is DevWars?</h3>
    <p>Here at DevWars we put your web development skills to the test. People of all levels are invited to participate
      in an exhilarating battle to create the best static HTML page they can within 1 hour. Teams are formed of 3
      people, with the team's members controlling a language each - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>Cool, so how do I get involved?</h3>
    <p>Easy! Just Sign up, head to our games page and apply to play. It's really that simple. Not only can you apply for
      new games, but you can view past games and their scores too.</p>
    <h3>But what if I think I'm not good enough?</h3>
    <p>Head over to the games page. There you can watch past streams that have been uploaded to Youtube. You can also
      view the code that created the websites you are viewing. There are also a list of objectives that teams needed to
      complete to help win the game. This will give you an idea of the sort of tasks you will be asked to complete if
      you were to play DevWars yourself!</p>
