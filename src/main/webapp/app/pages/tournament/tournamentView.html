        <p>Our lovely friends at Microsoft have given us a wonderful opportunity. They've sent us 3 Microsoft Surface
          Pro 3's to give away!</p>
        <p>We've decided that the best way to hand those out would be by hosting a tournament!</p>

        <h2>Great! How do I win?</h2>
        <p>All you have to do is enter your 3-man team into the tournament, and compete against the other DevWarriors to
          be the winners. The tournament will run every weekend through November. If you win, we'll send those Surface
          Pros your way. <b>(with keyboards!)</b></p>
