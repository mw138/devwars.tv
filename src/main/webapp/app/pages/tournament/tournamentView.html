				<h2>What's going on?!</h2>
				<p>Our lovely friends at Microsoft have given us a wonderful opportunity. They've sent us 3 Microsoft Surface Pro 3's to give away!</p>
				<p>We've decided that the best way to hand those out would be by hosting a tournament!</p>

				<h2>Great! How do I win?</h2>
				<p>All you have to do is enter your 3-man team into the tournament, and compete against the other DevWarriors to be the winners. The tournament will run every weekend through November. If you win, we'll send those Surface Pros your way. <b>(with keyboards!)</b></p>

				<h2>What do I need to know to compete?</h2>

					<li>HTML</li>

				<p>DevWars is a competition website based around frontend web-devlopment. Each of your team members will need to know 1 of these languages. (although all of them would be better!)</p>
